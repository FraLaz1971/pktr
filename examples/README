This directory contains examples of squirt scripts which demonstrate the three
main used of squirt, viewing, modifying and filtering telemetry.

Each script has comments describing what it does and how to use it.

This directory also contains a sample telemetry file telem.ccsds.
Squirt scripts read from stdin and write to stdout, so be careful to always
redirect stdout to a file, or you will have alot of binary dumped to your
screen.

Check the first (#!) line of the scripts before you use them. You should
probably change these to indicate where you installed squirt.
